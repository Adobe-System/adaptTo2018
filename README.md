### Build event-driven integrations with AEM using Adobe I/O Events

Tired of building connectors for AEM? 

Join us in this lab us where we will implement a real-time and lightweight integration with AEM with almost no code.
Come and learn how you can expose any internal `osgi` events from AEM through Adobe I/O Events to build event-driven workflows across multiple systems with ease.
See how Adobe I/O Events allows you to respond to both administrative events and customer behaviors in real-time.
