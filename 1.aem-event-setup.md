# Setting up AEM Events with Adobe I/O Events

These instructions describe how to set up AEM 6.4 for Adobe I/O Events for our AdaptTo 2018 lab.
 
## Pre-requisite and pre-defined Authorizations

To complete this lab, you will need authorization to use the following products/services:

*  An AEM instance, 6.4.x, with administrative permissions.
  * we assume this will be a no-brainer, you must be all familiar with AEM at this conference, right ?
*  [Adobe I/O Console](https://adobe.io/console) access, with administrative permissions for your enterprise/lab organization 
  * we prepared a set of accounts for you to use in this lab
  * we will all be using a test Organization, `id`-ed: `2A74564158A4D56F0A495C55@AdobeOrg`  

In order to speed things up as we only have 30 minutes
* we pre-baked a certificate and an its associated keystore. 
  It will be used to secure the communication between your AEM instance and `adobe.io` - exchanging a JWT token to fetch an oAuth access token) 
  * browse the [certs folder](./certs). In there you'll find
    * the public certificate expected by `adobe.io` [`certificate_pub.crt`](./certs/certificate_pub.crt)
    * the associated private key and signed certificate stuffed into a PKCS#12 [`keystore.p12`](./certs/keystore.p12)
   that you'll use when configuring your AEM instance

* an integration is also pre-defined on `adobe.io` console at https://console.adobe.io/integrations/43611/47460/overview
  * using the accounts mentioned above you should be able to access it, just in case you cant, [here are the info you need](certs/console.md)
      

### Install the AEM Adobe I/O Events(`aem-event-proxy`) package

To install the AEM event proxy package:

1. Download the latest version of the package: [version 6.4.255](https://github.com/adobeio/adobeio-documentation/files/2119312/aem-event-proxy-6.4.255.zip)

2. Open AEM Package Manager by selecting the **Tools** icon and then selecting **Deployment** and **Packages**.

3. In **Package Manager**, select **Upload Package**. Select **Browse** and navigate to the package zip file. Select **OK**.

4. Select **Install**.

5. Watch the **Activity Log**. If installed, the log reports that the package is imported.

For more information on installing packages in AEM, see [How to Work with Packages](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/administering/using/package-manager.html).

### Add the certificate into the AEM `eventproxy-service` keystore


1. In AEM, open the **User Management** group by selecting the **Tools** icon and then selecting **Security** and **Users.**
Or just browse to http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/security/content/useradmin.html

2. Scroll down and Select **eventproxy-service** to open it.
 
3. Select **KeyStore>Create KeyStore**

4. Create the password (let's all use `admin` again to keep things simple)

5. Select **Add Private Key from Key Store file.** 

6. Click on **Select KeyStore File** : upload the  [`keystore.p12`](./certs/keystore.p12) 
   
    * enter `eventproxy` as the `new Alias`
    * enter `admin` as the `KeyStore File Password`
    * enter `eventproxy` as the `Private Key Alias`
    * enter `admin` as the `Private Key Password`
    * Click **Submit** 
  
7. Click on **Save and Close**  
  
### Configure the AEM Link Externalizer

Next is for you to specify the base url of your AEM instance.

This base URL will appear on the Adobe I/O Console 
and will be use to compute some of the url in the event payload... 

Do not use only the word “localhost” as the default name because others may use it. 
This will then cause confusion and make it difficult to determine which instance is yours. 

Configure is as something unique-to-you like `yourfistname.yourlastname.com`

For that you will configure `Day CQ Link Externalizer`:

1. Open the Web Console, or select the **Tools** icon, then select **Operations** and **Web Console**. 
 or just go to http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr 
2. Scroll down the list to find **Day CQ Link Externalizer**, 
 * edit the second `author` line with something like `author http://yourfirstname.yourlastname.com:4502` 
 * select **Save** when done.
 
Note that the default `AEM Link Externalizer name` in `Adobe I/O Events' Configuration` is `author`
 But this can be changed

### Configure Adobe I/O Events as a cloud service in AEM


1. Open the Cloud Services console, or select the **Security** icon, and then select **Adobe IMS Configurations**. 
or just browse to http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/adobeims-configuration/content/configurations.html
   
2. Click **Create**; 
   **Select `AdobeIOEvents`** in the Cloud Solution drop down; 
   once selected, you should see the certificate you just added to the AEM `eventproxy-service` user's keystore;
   Click **Next** 
   
3. Fill in the various entries expected to configure the IMS account associated with the integration 
 we have created for you in the Adobe I/O Console (cf. https://console.adobe.io/integrations/43611/47460/overview)
 If you can't access the console please refer to this [file](./certs/console.md)

    *   For **Title**: specify `Adobe IO Events` (or any other title that makes sense to you).
    *   For **Authorization Server**: `https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com` (unless the URL shown in the **JWT** tab of your integration page in the Adobe I/O Console is different), 
    *   For **API key**: Provide the API key shown in the **Overview** tab of your integration page in the Adobe I/O Console. 
    *   For **Client Secret**: Provide the Client Secret shown in the **Overview** tab of your integration page in the Adobe I/O Console. 
    *   For **Payload**: Provide the JWT payload shown in the **JWT** tab of your integration page in the Adobe I/O Console.

4. Click **Create**
    
5. Now you should see this new Adobe IO Events IMS Configuration, and you can select it to check its health.

 
## Done ?

The AEM set up is done, AEM is now already emitting events to `adobe.io`
But only a pre-defined sets of events
and these events are going nowhere beyond.

So, next let's [create a receiving end to these events](2.aem-event-webhooks.md)
